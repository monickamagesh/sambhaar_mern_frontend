            To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use
            “cookies” or similar electronic tools to collect information to
            assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification

            Identified Computer. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself
            (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing
            who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only
            personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply.
            A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may
            also assign their cookies to your browser (if you click on their
            ads), a process that we do not control.

            to measure traffic within our site, and let advertisers know the
